1.  A of B 语法现象

A 核心词 如果作主语后面谓语动作是和A有关的,`例外： ` A 
如果是数词核心词是B,如：A number of, A lot of,这样可以看
出The number of 的核心词是A
```text
A history of long and effortless success can be a
dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, 
it may become a driving force. 
2When the United States entered just 
such a glowing period after the end of 
the Second World War, 
it had a market eight times 
larger than any competitor, 
giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. 
3Its scientists were the worlds best; 
its workers the most skilled. 
4(11)America and Americans were prosperous 
beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians 
whose economies the war had destroyed.
  1It was inevitable that this primacy should have 
narrowed as other countries grew richer. 
2Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. 
3By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves
at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. 
4Some huge American industries, such as consumer electronics,
had shrunk or vanished in the face of foreign competition. 
5By 1987 there was only one American television maker left, Zenith. 
6(Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea’s LG 
Electronics in July.) 
7(12)Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into 
the domestic market.   
America’s machine-tool industry was on the ropes. 
8For a while it looked as though the making of semiconductors,
which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the 
new computer age, was going to be the next casualty.
  1All of this caused a crisis of confidence. 
2Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted. 
3They began to believe that their way of doing business was failing,
and that their incomes would therefore shortly begin to fall as well.
4The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another into 
the causes of America’s industrial decline. 
5Their sometimes sensational findings were filled 
with warnings about the growing competition from overseas.
  1How things have changed! 
2In 1995 the United States can look 
back on five years of solid growth while Japan has been struggling.
3 ( 14 ) Few Americans attribute this solely to such 
obvious causes as a devalued dollar or the turning of 
the business cycle. 4Self-doubt has yielded to blind pride. 
5“American industry has
changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to 
be more quick-witted,” according to Richard Cavanaugh,
executive dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. 
6“It makes me proud to be an American just to see how our 
businesses are improving their productivity,” 
says Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute,
a think-tank in Washington, DC. 
7And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes 
that people will look back on this period as “a golden 
age of business management in the United States.”
```

> 一个历史(介词短语修饰这个history)可能是一个不利条件，
主干： A history can be a handicap,其他都是修改是附加
的东西

2. 状语从句

状语大部分情况下就是等于副词(本质用来修饰动词/形容词/介词/一句话),
```text
example: I play soccer well(我非常好的踢足球)
>> 这个well是用来修饰play的这个动作,并且副词可以放在任何位置
example2: I can eat this apple fast(我可以快速的吃这个苹果)
>> fast的本质是修饰这个eat的 
```
> 状语从句就是副词的这个位置是一个句子结构
关系连词+分句(状语从句不能是一个完整的句子后面主谓宾), 主谓宾;这个状语
从句修饰这个主谓宾的谓语,主谓宾也可以放在前面example: when I am
happy, I can play soccer(当我高兴的这个状态的时候，我可以踢足球),
**当分句的主语和主句的主语一样的时候可以省略分句的主语，如果
分句有be动词be动词也可以省略**

| 关系连词 | because | though | although | why | if | when | while |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----|----|------|-------|

```text
如果被it被合适地处理，it有可能变成一个驱动力
if properly handled, it may become a driving force
>> it代词上文的history,if引导的状语从句，省略了主语和be
 动词
```
3. 非谓语
一个句子一把只有一个谓语，但是有时候还想要使用动作，那么就要使用非谓语动词的形式

  - 没有逗号
```text
I like to use computer having some software; 
没有逗号的非谓语动词having
some software 一般修饰前面的名词并且主动关系使用ing形式,如果被动关系使用被动形式
```
  - 有逗号
```text
I like to do exercise, making me happy；
有逗号这个非谓语动词就不一定修饰的是前面的名词了


```
4. 分号
一般出现分号那么前后都是个完整的句子，但是两者是有关系的，前后都是be动词后面
可以省略
```text
Its scientists were the worlds best; 
its workers the most skilled
> workers 后面省略了were
```
5. 定于从句
用来修饰名词 === 形容词
```text
  I have an apple that is red
  > that 关系代词代替apple 并且是单数使用is
```
  - 限定性定语从句(没有逗号)

限制修饰前面的名词,例如上面的例子就是用来修饰apple的that/which都可以,如果前面修饰的人
那么可以是用who,whose就是who‘s前面名词的。。。。，任何物体都可以使用whose
关系代词代表前面的修饰名词

```text
  I hava a computer whose software is good
  > 我有一个计算机，这个计算机的软件是好的

 example3: I like this book I read
 当先行词在定于从句中做宾语的时候关系代词可以省略
```
  - 非限定性定于从句(有逗号)
```text
 example4: I like to books, which is useful for me
 非限定性定于从句有逗号，只能用which用来修饰前面一句话(我喜欢读书这件事情
 是非常的有用的为了我),这句话是一个单数，如果形容books那么就是are

 example5: I like this table on which there is a book;
 带介词的定语从句,which代替前面的名词,on which 不能作为成分，后面
 是一个完整的句子,如：I like this book through which I can learn many
 things

```

`定于从句和状语从句的区别，其实就是这两个词where和when它们即可以状语从句
和定语从句,状语就是修饰动词，定语修饰名词，I like the school where I
can learn many thing
定语从句：我喜欢这个学校，在学校里我能够学习很多事情  
状语从句：我喜欢这学校，在我可以学到很多东西的地方(表示的是在什么时候我喜欢呢)
`

6. 形式主语
```text
 结构： it is adj (for sb) to do sth (it
 没有实际的意思，代替后面的do sth)
 example1: It is important to learn math
 It 代替后面的learn math (学数学是非常重要到)

 example2: It is useful that I learn math
 It 代替后面的从句(我学习数学这件事情是有用的)

 ```

7. As

 - 关系连词===》引导状语从句(因为/当),正如：As you seen,正如你看到的那样

 - 介词翻译成作为  As a person, I should learn things; 

8. at a loss over 困惑/不知所措

```text
a is at a loss over b
a 对于b是不知所措的
```
  
8. find A B / make A(名词) B(n/v/prep/adj)
如果是n词那么就是发现A是B/让A成为B，其他词就a怎么怎么样
